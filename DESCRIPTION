Description: Agricultural data for 1888-2021 from the Morrow Plots at the 
    University of Illinois. The world's second oldest ongoing agricultural 
    experiment, the Morrow Plots measure the impact of crop rotation and 
    fertility treatments on corn yields. The data includes planting information
    and annual yield measures for corn grown continuously and in rotation with
    other crops, in treated and untreated soil.
